# ffmpeg editlist utility

Often, one wants to reprocess a video file using some basic
operations, such as removing certain segments.  Rather than opening a
video editor, it is nice to be able to define a text file (the
**editlist**) with processing instructions, and then run it.  This
allows collaboration in the processing, for example sharing the
editlist file via git.

This utility takes a YAML definition of an editlist (segments to cut
out and re-assemble into a file), and does the re-assembling using the
ffmpeg command line utility.

This is currently an alpha-level utility: it works, but expect it may
not exactly fit your use case without a bit of work.  Documentation is
minimal but still needs improvement.  However, it has been used for
several large events.

Features include:

* YAML edit list definition.
* Select segments to stitch together in the final video file.
  Segments are either copied raw or re-encoded (`--reencode`).
* Give Table of Contents times (for example, '16:45: Lesson 2 begins')
  relative to the source video, output mapped to times in
  the output video automatically.
* Cover certain areas of video (for example, when an audience member
  appears).
* Everything scripted and non-interactive.
* Cutting and re-splicing subtitles, too.



## Installation and dependencies

This is on PyPI, may be installed with `pip install ffmpeg-editlist`.
The only dependency is PyYAML so it might be reasonable to install
with `pip install --user`.  This creates a `ffmpeg-editlist` command
in your environment.

For usage without installing, `ffmpeg_editlist.py` works as
stand-alone with only `pyyaml`.

It depends on the `ffmpeg` command line utility, which must be
installed through the operating system.  Version requirements of
`ffmpeg` are currently unknown.



## Usage

Start with a directory of your videos (example: `day1-raw.mkv`).

Create an edit list file (described in next section).  A minimal
example is:

```yaml
- input: day1-raw.mkv

- output: part1.mkv
  title: This is the title of part1
  description: >-
    This is the multi-line description
    of part 1.
  editlist:
    - start: 00:00   # These are time segments to include
    - 4:00: Begin exercise 1
    - stop: 5:00
    - start: 6:13
    - -: Going over the exercises  # '-' means "latest start time".
    - stop: 99:00
```

The general usage is then:

```
python ffmpeg-editlist.py EDITLIST.yaml INPUT-DIR [-o OUTPUT-DIR]
```

Where `INPUT-DIR` is the search path for input files and `OUTPUT-DIR`
(default `.`) is the output path for files.  You can use the `--limit
PATTERN` option to reprocess only a few videos (example: `--limit
part1`).

Because of the way keyframes work, there may be missing segments
around the transition points.  After you have tested that your timings
seem reasonable, re-run with ``--reencode`` and it will do a full
re-encoding and make a seamless videos.  The default encoding settings
are designed to be slow but good enough for all practical purposes:

```
python ffmpeg-editlist.py EDITLIST.yaml --reencode INPUT-DIR [-o OUTPUT-DIR]
```

`OUTPUT-DIR` will get the encoded files, and `.txt` files with the
video descriptions ready to upload to your video hosting site.

Subtitles: The option `--srt` will make ffmpeg-editlist reprocess
subtitles just like video segments (cut to the segments and adjust
timestamps).  A `.srt` file is expected alongside each input file
(input file's extension replaced with `.srt`), and an output is
similarly placed alongside each output.  Warning: make sure that no
segment's declared stop time goes beyond the actual file length.  It's
possible that there will be some weird effects around the
beginning/end of the segments if subtitles go beyond the start/stop.



## Editlist definition


### Minimal example: single file

```yaml
# Input is taken from command line argument `input`.
- output: output.mp4
  title: This is the title
  description: >-
    This is the multi-line description.
  editlist:
    - start: 00:00   # These are time segments to include
    - stop: 5:00
    - start: 6:13
    - stop: 99:00
```

Run with `python ffmpeg-editlist.py editlist.yaml input.mkv`.


### Minimal example with multiple files

```yaml

- input: raw-day1.mkv
  output: day1-part1.mkv
  editlist:
    - start: 1:12
    - stop: 55:30

# Previous input file is used if no new input is defined
- output: day1-part2.mkv
  editlist:
    - start: 1:00:12
    - stop: 1:54:00
```

Run with `python ffmpeg-editlist.py editlist.yaml $input_directory`.


### Multi-file with video descriptions

This is a full example that demonstrates all features.

```yaml

- workshop_description: >
    If this exists, it will be appended to the bottom of every video
    description.  For example, it can be general information about the
    overall workshop.

# This input will be used for all segments until redefined
# Input relative to the input-dir command line argument.
# If not given, use the raw input-dir argument as a filename.
- input: cr-2021may-day1-obs.mov

# A basic example
# Output is relative to the output-dir command line argument.
- output: day1-welcome.mp4
  # If given, do not reencode this segment even if --reencode is given
  # (useful for segments that start at 00:00).  'reencode: true' does
  # nothing, this is the default and --reencode must still be
  # specified on the command line.
  #reencode: false
  editlist:
    - start: 12:20
    - stop: 31:14

# Git-intro day 1
- output: day1-git-intro-1.mp4    # Output filename
  title: YouTube Video Title
  description: >
    Description of the video.
  editlist:
    # These pairs are times to *include*
    - start: 31:14
    - stop: 38:13
    - start: 41:28
    - stop: 1:04:45

# A sample including table of contents entries.
# You need to map times from the raw file, to the output file, in
# order to make a clickable YouTube table of contents.
# They are times in the
# original video, and they are converted to the equivalent times in
# the processed videos. They must be within the ranges above (and
# you get a unhandled error if they aren't):
#   segment_start <= toc_time < segment_stop.
# These can be interspersed with the segment definitions.
# Example:
- output: day2-git-intro-2.mp4
  editlist:
    - start: 31:14
    # TOC entry:
    - 31:14: Overview of the day
    - 33:25: Motivation to version control
    - stop: 38:13
    - start: 41:28
    - -: Basics of version control        # '-' is an alias for "last start"
    - 48:35: "Exercise: record changes"   # has a ':', so must be quoted
    - stop: 1:04:45
    #- 1:18:22: This will fail, timestamp after the end

This syntax is used to cover a segment of the video:
- output: day3-has-audience-visible.mp4
  editlist:
  - start: 00:00
  # Cover an area.  begin/end are clear.  w and h are width and
  # height.  x and y are offset (left, down) from the top-left corner
  - cover: {begin: "1:15:29", end: "1:51:34", w: 840, h: 300, x: 360}
  - stop: 5:00


```

Alongside the `.mp4` output file, a `.mp4.info.txt` file is created
with these contents.  This is designed for easy copying and pasting
into hosting sites:

```
Title of Video

Video description.

01:53 Table of contents entry 1
15:45 Table of contents entry 2
...


Workshop description.
```


### Multiple inputs

Multiple inputs in one segment might be useful when you are attaching
an introduction to the main video.  Note that things might go wrong if
the video sizes and codecs do not align perfectly.  (TODO: does this
work as expected?)

```yaml
- output: output.mp4
  editlist:
    - input: intro.mkv
    - start: 00:00
    - stop: 99:00
    - input: main.mkv
    - start: 0:00
    - stop: 99:00
    - input: outro.mkv
    - start: 0:00
    - stop: 99:00

```

## Status / Contributing

Alpha/beta, under development, it is starting to become reusable but
still development is for a few use cases.  In order to use this you
probably have to read some code / work around some bugs since it isn't
well tested yet.

Bug reports or improvements welcome, but it is kind of a mess now.
Test with ``pytest ffmpeg-editlist.py``, but note that main
functionality is not tested right now.
